../demos contains:
	test_exp1.m: Plots figures of cost and SNR as a function of R1, R2, R3. You can choose to fix R2= R1 or R3. Data and figure saves automatically.

	test_exp2.m: Experiments on the reconstruction of spectral signature. You can plot all spectra, only portions, relative + normalized error. Uses data from text_exp1. Data and figure saves automatically.

	test_exp3.m: Experiments on metrics for different methods. You can pick tensor rank and multilinear ranks. Uses HySure results. Tables save automatically.

	test_exp4.m: Same experiments as test_exp1 but with HS-Pan fusion. Data and figure saves automatically.
RUN ONE OF THESE TO GET RESULTS 

../utils contains:
	crop.m: crops data to the specified dimensions

	gauss_kernel.m: Creates 1D gaussian filter with specified size and parameter sigma

	solveC_normal.m: used in tenRec to solve C with normal equation

	solveC_qr.m: used in tenRec to solve C with normal equation and QR factorization (for complexity purposes)

	spatial_deg.m: generates P1 and P2 with specified downsampling ratio

	spectral_deg.m: generates Pm from specified sensor (Landsat or Quickbird)
